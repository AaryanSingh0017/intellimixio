# C Programming Language
- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world

- If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar

- C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python

- C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies

# C++ Programming Language
- C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

- C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.

- C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

- C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

- C++ is fun and easy to learn!

- As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

# JAVA Programming Language
- Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
 
- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
 
- It has a large demand in the current job market

- It is easy to learn and simple to use

- It is open-source and free

- It is secure, fast and powerful

- It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)

- Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs

- As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa

# Python Programming Language
- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).

- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.

- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.

- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.

- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

# Bootstrap
- Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development

- Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins

- Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs

# Augmented Reality
Augmented reality (AR) is the integration of digital information with the user's environment in real time. Unlike virtual reality (VR), which creates a totally artificial environment, AR users experience a real-world environment with generated perceptual information overlaid on top of it.

Augmented reality is used to either visually change natural environments in some way or to provide additional information to users. The primary benefit of AR is that it manages to blend digital and three-dimensional (3D) components with an individual's perception of the real world. AR has a variety of uses, from helping in decision-making to entertainment.

AR delivers visual elements, sound and other sensory information to the user through a device like a smartphone or glasses. This information is overlaid onto the device to create an interwoven experience where digital information alters the user's perception of the real world. The overlaid information can be added to an environment or mask part of the natural environment.

# HACKTOBERFEST 2022
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source projects, their maintainers, and the entire community of contributors. It’s a time to contribute to open source, improve your skills, and build greater technology in the process.
This online event has been happening every October for the last nine years and is sponsored by DigitalOcean. Last year Hacktoberfest witnessed a total of 294,451 successfully merged pull requests and 141,802 registered participants.

It’s free to participate in and open to everyone in the world. Whether you are a programmer, designer, writer, tester, translator, artist, or simply someone who wants to learn more about software development, any contribution is appreciated!

Whether It’s Your First Time—Or Your Ninth— It’s Time To Hack Out! Sign up for Hacktoberfest 2022 and start contributing!
